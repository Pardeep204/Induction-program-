My day one in GNDEC begins on 30 july. All the students reached college at 8:30am and first we arrived to gurudwara sahib for the kirtan. After the kirtan, everyone had tea and snacks and then we headed to auditorium for induction program. The NCC cadets were maintaining descipline in the auditorium. The induction program begins with Principal sir's speec. The speech given by him was very motivational. And then the HOD of applied science Harpreet Mam gave a strong speech on career.Then Chief guest gave the speech . He told us about the origin and foundation of GNDEC and his speech left lasting effect on the students. After that the students were taken to visit their departments.After the department vist our first day of college ended.
